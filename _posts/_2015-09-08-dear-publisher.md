You may, of course, utterly disregard the unsolicited advice of an independent writer and publisher. To be honest with you, I don’t care whether or not you do. Publishers come and go; and if false pride keeps you from accepting a genuine offer you are evidently in want of, I for one will not miss you. Yet, if not for your own, it is for your authors’ and your readers’ sake, that you should hear me out — and you better listen carefully.<!--more-->

Let me be clear about this first: Software piracy is a crime. There cannot be two minds about that. Being a writer myself, I know to appreciate that every author and publisher out there is concerned about losing money as a result of software proliferation, illicit trading and distribution.

That being said, I shall not fail to inform you that by employing Digital Rights Management (<abbr>DRM</abbr>) schemes, like <em>Adobe</em>’s <abbr>DRM</abbr>, you do nothing to protect your authors or your own business. Your efforts are literally in vain. Even more so, you risk to irritate and confuse the average reader, and by such hurt your prospective sales.

This statement is difficult to support, I know. All you rely on is the number of sales you already made. What you don’t know, however, is the number of people who decided against buying from you on grounds of your decision to restrict their right to use the book they were about to purchase. Who knows, perhaps it is a good thing that you and your authors will never find out just how many actually did.

I’m sure that you acted with the best intention and out of a sense of duty. Without a doubt, you tried your best. Yet all you really accomplished was to prove that you have not comprehended the fundamental concept of digital media — or <abbr>DRM</abbr> — yet. You may have considered <abbr>DRM</abbr> to be a digital version of the copyright notice in printed books — which, by the way, is just as useless in order to prevent illicit distribution.

There have been copyright laws in effect for much longer than any of us exists. Yet it is not the letter of the law which guarantees that publisher, author, and everyone else involved in the production and distribution of a book, will be compensated for their effort. What keeps them all in business is the fact that most readers are honest; they don’t deserve to be treated like potential criminals. Yet this is exactly what you do when you implement <abbr>DRM</abbr> schemes in your books.

It may still not be clear to some of you why <abbr>DRM</abbr> is dubbed “Digital Restrictions Management” by those who advocate open source software. Let me relate a number of examples to clarify what we are looking at here.

When you decide to purchase a book, you have usually two main options today. You may obtain a printed version (you know, the pile of bound paper that may — depending on how busy the author was — double as either a letter weight or a blunt weapon), or a digital version.

Except for the waste of safe drinking, used to produce mentioned piles of bound paper, there is not much wrong with the printed version. You may bring and read your book practically everywhere. Go to the brick–and–mortar shop, or order it from the many online bookshops, wait untill you have it in hand, and start reading.

With the digital edition, however, things become a tad more complex. You may choose between a number of shops and a number of formats, depending on which vendor you have already an account with or which reading device you happen to prefer.

Some of us, like yours truly, prefer reading devices and software that support a wide range of formats, because we like to read the books we paid the full price for virtually everywhere. There is no obvious reason why we should cope with arbitrary limitations. We don’t want to care whether there is a <abbr>Wifi</abbr>–connection available in the area we happen to be in, or about the format the vendor happens to provide.

After all, the book’s content and quality are always the same (or so we shall hope), whether you are stuck in the middle of nowhere or snuggled down on your comfy three–seater in your own living room; whether it came as an <abbr>.epub</abbr>, <abbr>.mobi</abbr>, or <abbr>.pdf</abbr> file. (I know that there are more possible formats, but these three happen to be the most popular at the time of writing.)

Yet to this end — to enjoy your book without restrictions where and when you please, that is — it is necessary to actually get your hand on a hard copy, just as you would when you purchased a printed version.

<h3><abbr>DRM</abbr> versus <abbr>DRM</abbr>–free</h3>
When you buy an electronic book (e–book), space and environment should be rather irrelevant. After all, that’s the whole point of the digital age. Once the checkout procedure is complete, you may download your book and start reading. If you happen to have three different devices you use alternatively, so be it. No one gives a damn — just as no one gave a damn whether you read your printed edition in the bed, bathroom, or garden. I don’t know about you, but I usually don’t haul my desktop into the bathroom and I have no internet connection in the garden.

Things are considerably less relaxed, when you buy a <abbr>DRM</abbr> infested copy. You may download it instantly too, but you will have to create an account with <em>Adobe</em> and download their proprietary reader, called <em>Adobe Digital Editions</em> (<abbr>ADE</abbr>), before you may start reading.

That is not much of an issue if you are somewhat technically inclined and don’t believe that commonplace “oh, it’s all so easy and just one click away” crap everyone keeps telling us. If not, a fast reader may be three or four chapters ahead of you, by the time you are finished with the technical preliminaries (just to give you an idea). The problem is that no one provides advance information that you will have to have <abbr>ADE</abbr> installed to be able to read the book.

So what’s the point of <abbr>DRM</abbr> again? Oh, right! It is supposed to prevent software piracy and protect copyrights. “I hear the message, but I believe no more”, is all I can say to this. Well, to be perfectly honest with you, I never believed it. Now that I have purchased a number of books infested with <abbr>DRM</abbr>, I can tell you that <abbr>DRM</abbr> is perfectly pointless. Here’s why:

<h3><abbr>DRM</abbr> is Perfectly Pointless!</h3>
You have to create an account with <em>Adobe</em>, and you have to download their reader — which is free of charge, by the way. The only one profiting from this scheme is <em>Adobe</em>, the self–excited “Guardian of Digital Rights”. Now that they have your e–mail address, they can advertise the heck out of you. Since you may install their software wherever you please, you may also read the books any place and with any device you want (as long as your device allows for <abbr>.epub</abbr> software, that is).

They do pretend to check for genuineness of an item every time you try to open a book, but they don’t. If you lauch a book with <abbr>ADE</abbr> without an internet connection, the software will throw two messages (which you simply confirm) and then give you access to the book. It’s the same procedure, whether you launch a book with or without <abbr>DRM</abbr>; whether you have or have not flushed your computer’s memory. As long as <abbr>ADE</abbr> is installed, you are good to go.

<h3>What’s the Story with <abbr>ePUB</abbr>, Anyway?</h3>
It’s pure irony that someone goes and tries to restrict access to an open source format like <abbr>ePUB</abbr> (also written <abbr>EPUB</abbr>). An <abbr>.epub</abbr> file is basically a zipped (compressed) folder that contains .html files. To simplify this explanation even more, imagine the entire content (text, pictures, etc.) of a website stuffed in a folder, a couple of smaller files added, and then the lot being compressed.

If <em>Adobe</em>, or anyone really, believes that this will stop software piracy, I’m prepared to rather put my money on a pimple–faced script kiddie. After all, it doesn’t take a <a rel="external" title="Check out the Brody Taylor series by Ian Sutherland" href="https://ianhsutherland.com/brody-taylor-thriller-series/">Brody Taylor</a> — or some such hacker — to simply copy the visible content of a book into a decent <abbr>ASCII</abbr> editor, write a template, add the necessary tags to each file, prepare the navigation and Table of Contents, and compress it, with the cover image and all.

It is an open source format, remember? No reverse engineering or black magic employed. It may take a week or so (depending on the volume of the book), but then you have the same book without <abbr>DRM</abbr> — only better formatted, perhaps. I’d hold any bet that most publishers with all their fancy toys out there took considerably longer to achieve less.

<h3>Is the Kindle Edition a Better Option?</h3>
No. If anything, the Kindle Edition of a book is even worse, as far as the general public is concerned. Unless you are the owner of a Kindle reading device (things may be just perfect with one of those), buying your e–book from <em>Amazon</em> gets you in a position that’s best described with a metaphor.

Imagine you buy a printed book in a brick–and–mortar store. At the checkout, you will have to hand over your money, but you are not to take your copy home. Instead, it is placed in a shop window. Every time you want to read it, you will have to appear in front of this window, behind which a shop assistant turns the pages for you, and places the bookmark wherever you decide to stop. If you want to actually touch your copy, you will have to rent some place in the shop, where your copy will be stored then.

For those who don’t like nice little stories, it translates to this: You pay the full price, but you won’t receive a hard copy — unless you rent some space in their cloud, which costs an annual fee equivalent to ten or so books. If you don’t have a Kindle reader and no cloud space, you will have to use their “Cloud Reader”, some phoney software that renders the content even worse than the aforementioned <abbr>ADE</abbr>. Kindle or no, you will always have to connect to their server before being able to read the book (that’s what <em>Amazon</em> states, at least). Am I the only one who reads e–books offline?

Like the <abbr>ePUB</abbr> format, Kindle’s <abbr>MOBI</abbr> (or Mobi) is nothing but a differently structured and compressed collection of HTML files. Just in case you wondered, <abbr>MOBI</abbr> being a proprietary format and all. Consequently, it is similarly easy reproducable. That much for all that copyrights protection and anti–piracy yada.

<h3>What’s My Point, Then?</h3>
Do your readers a favour and give them what they expect: easy to obtain and easy to read, damn well organised and produced books. That’s what they — and your authors — pay for.

If you really want to keep software piracy at bay, just inform your readers of acknowledged vendors that do your books. Consequently, all those not listed are potential deceivers who have to show colours. It’s a disgrace that unsuspecting readers are considered guilty until proved innocent.

Is there anything left for you to do on this matter? Actually, yes. You could do a lot. Round up your competitors in the industry and jointly advocate adequate copyright laws, so your readers are no longer at risk of falling foul of the law for having the same e–book installed on two of their devices. Case closed — for now.
