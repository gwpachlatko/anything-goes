<h3>Data Base and Harvesters</h3>
While <a rel="external" title="Visit the software’s homepage" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Dr Jekyll</a> carefully removed the data base, Mr Hyde got rid of all supposedly sinister data harvesters. In other words, all features that could possibly serve to identify visitors to this site have been removed. Neither has _Anything Goes_ the infrastructure nor its author the intention to collect your data.
<h3>Plugins</h3>
Except for “<a title="see source code on GitHub" href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed">jekyll–feed</a>” (which is available by default; it provides the, well, “Feed”), none of the plugins available for Jekyll is present.
<h3>Fonts</h3>
I do reference Google Fonts, but I honestly fail to see how Google could possibly benefit from knowing that any individual visited a site employing fonts they provide.
<h3>Cookies</h3>
It appears that GitHub sets a session cookie every time you visit a page or site hosted on their server. This cookie, however, is “eaten” the instant you close your browser (it is not persistent, in other words). If you decide to block all cookies, or set your browser to delete them upon exit, you are not likely to experience any difference. Apparently, its only use is to provide a stable session.
<h3>Comments</h3>
I do employ a service called <a rel="external" title="Visit Disqus’ homepage" href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> for comments. It not only is the quasi–standard for Static Site Generators, it also is a convenient means to keep trolls in their caves. All comments contributed through this service are publicly accessible and associated with the respective user. Here’s <a rel="external" title="link to Disqus’ Privacy Policy" href="https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy">how Disqus handles user data</a> (and their <a rel="external" title="link to Disqus’ Cookie Policy" href="https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/">Cookie Policy</a>).
<h3>One–To–One Communication</h3>
If you decide to contact me via e–mail, please know that I tend to delete e–mail addresses and content of one–off contacts immediately after communication is complete. Consequently, it is quite possible that I won’t recognise you from “last time” you shot me a mail. This has not to do with data protection, but is a means to prevent clutter.
<h3>Server and Source Code</h3>
This website is hosted by GitHub. See <a title="link to GitHub’s Privacy Statement" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement">how GitHub handles user data</a>. The [source code of this website](https://github.com/gwpachlatko/anything-goes) is publicly available.
